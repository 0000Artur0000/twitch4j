# Contributing to Twitch4J
Thanks for considering to help out on his project.

## Issues
If there is a problem with a feature please tell me, just please make sure to follow the [template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)
in order to allow me to more easily identify the issue and fix it. Questions and suggestions are also welcome to be
posted as an issue, however I'd rather talk about it in a better medium than Github issues so I would prefer if you talk
to me about it on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FQ5vgW3).

## Pull Requests
So, you are thinking about sending a pull request, awesome! Before starting on your pull request, you should read up on
the [pull request template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

Just a few things to note when submitting a pull request:

1. All your code will be subject to the project's licence, in this case [MIT](https://github.com/PhilippHeuer/twitch4j/blob/master/LICENSE).
2. You cannot modify this project's style (i.e. indentation style, bracket style, naming, etc).
Rewrites of certain systems are fine too.
3. Create your pull-request against the `develop` branch! 

### Style Requirements
* This project uses [1tbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS), with the exception that single 
line if statements do not need brackets.
* All instanced objects should have getters and setters (where reasonable)
