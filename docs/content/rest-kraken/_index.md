# Twitch API - Kraken (v5)

To identify your application to the API, every request must include your applicationâ€™s client ID, either explicitly or implicitly by including an OAuth token. If you use an OAuth token in your request, the API figures out the client ID for you.

Requests can include both a client ID and an OAuth token. Requests without either one fail with an HTTP 400 error.

To get a client ID, register your application on the Twitch dev portal. Once you have your client ID, you can send it via:

```
Request header (Client-ID: XXXXX)
Query-string parameter
(https://api.twitch.tv/kraken/users/44322889?client_id=XXXXX)
```
