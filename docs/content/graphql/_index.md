# Twitch4J - GraphQL

*Experimental / Unofficial*

The GraphQL API is as unofficial as it can be. It only works by emulating the twitch website (`clientId` and `accessToken` matching the `clientId` of the twitch site itself).

## API Methods

User:

- [User -> Follow User](./user-follow)
- [User -> Unfollow User](./user-unfollow)
